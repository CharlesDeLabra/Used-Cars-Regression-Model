## Context

There is a huge demand for used cars in the Indian Market today. As sales of new cars have slowed down in the recent past, the pre-owned car market has continued to grow over the past few years and is now larger than the new car market. Cars4U is a budding tech start-up that aims to find footholes in this market. Unlike new cars, where price and supply are fairly deterministic and managed by OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturer / except for dealership level discounts which come into play only in the last stage of the customer journey), the used car market is a very different beast, with large uncertainties in both pricing and supply. Several factors, including mileage, brand, model, year, etc. can influence the actual worth of a car. From the perspective of a seller, it is not an easy task to set the correct price of a used car. Keeping this in mind, the pricing scheme of these used cars becomes important in order to grow in the market. 


## Problem Statement

It is needed to develop a price prediction model in order to be able to predict used cars prices based on the features of each cars. It is provided a dataset with features of each cars such as; Mileage, Brand, Mode, Power, Engine, Type of Owner, etc. The task is to analize the data and come with different regresion solution in order to find which model fits best to data and that will mean that is a better predictor.
